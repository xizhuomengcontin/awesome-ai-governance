# Awesome AI Agent Governance [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join-5865F2?logo=discord&logoColor=white&style=flat)](https://discord.gg/grgzFEHgkj)

Community updates and contributor highlights: [AgenTrust on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/agentrust-io/).

> A curated list of tools, frameworks, standards, and resources for governing autonomous AI agents, covering safety, trust, identity, observability, and compliance across the agent lifecycle.

AI agents now hold real reach: email, CRMs, databases, financial systems. Guardrails at the content layer probably hold, but enterprises need to run on proof, not probability. This list tracks the tools and practices for making agents safe, auditable, and trustworthy in production.

- [Proofpane](https://proofpane.com) - Runtime governance gateway for AI coding agents and MCP clients, enforcing policy gates and DLP redaction in the execution path with a hash-chained, offline-verifiable audit. Closed-source (proprietary daemon); [public reference architecture](https://github.com/Proofpane/architecture) under CC BY 4.0.

- [YYLO](https://github.com/yylo-dev/yylo) - Command-line orchestrator that governs coding-agent repository changes: each task freezes the protected target SHA and runs in a dedicated branch/worktree behind typed task, validation, merge, and release-readiness boundaries; the merge queue owns risk-based review (low risk has no semantic reviewer, high risk two sequential reviewers on one frozen candidate) and stops as REVIEW_FINDINGS_EXHAUSTED instead of starting an unbounded review loop; runs retain declared receipt hashes and terminal manifests as receipt-backed repository changes. MIT, on npm as @yylo/cli; orchestrates Pi and Codex subagents.

## End-to-End Governance: Software and Hardware

*Tools and platforms that combine software policy enforcement with hardware-attested execution. The software layer (Cedar policy, audit logs, agent identity) is measured into a Trusted Execution Environment so that the governance claims cannot be forged by a privileged operator, a compromised runtime, or a supply chain attack. The result is a compliance artifact that any third party can verify offline without trusting the operator.*

*The stack, in the order of the AgenTrust chain from weights to evidence: Weight Custody Manifest releases model-weight keys only to an attested runtime. Agent Manifest binds all ten deployment artifacts into one signed identity document. AGT enforces Cedar policies at the software layer, cMCP carries those policies into a TEE for MCP tool calls, and cA2A is a profile for verifiable agent-to-agent (A2A) delegation. TRACE records the attested outcome. OPAQUE Systems offers the commercial OPAQUE Confidential AI Platform™.*

- [Agent Manifest](https://github.com/agentrust-io/agent-manifest) - Signs all 10 agent deployment artifacts (system prompt, policy bundle, model identity, tool schemas, RAG corpus, memory baseline, decision trace, A2A delegation chain, build provenance, HITL approvals) into a single tamper-evident record. Hardware attestation via TPM, AMD SEV-SNP, or Intel TDX. Four conformance levels, with compliance mappings for the EU AI Act, DORA, GDPR, and HIPAA. 197 conformance tests. Python. Developer preview.
- [cMCP (Confidential MCP Gateway)](https://github.com/agentrust-io/cmcp) - An MCP gateway that evaluates tool calls against Cedar policy inside a TEE. In hardware deployments the policy bundle is measured into attestation before any code runs and the signing key stays in the enclave; software mode provides no hardware isolation. Every tool call produces a signed GatewayClaim bound to the hardware measurement. Supports TPM, AMD SEV-SNP, and Intel TDX attestation. Developer preview.
- [cA2A (Confidential A2A)](https://github.com/agentrust-io/ca2a) - A profile for the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, where A2A's Signed Agent Card verifies only a domain owner. Adds attested, attenuated delegation (each hop's authority is a provable subset of its parent's), runtime attestation of the peer, a sealed peer channel (binding the seal to a verified measurement on a live call is on the roadmap), and an offline-verifiable provenance record per hop. Reuses the delegation semantics from Agent Manifest and the TEE and policy primitives from cMCP. Python, developer preview; installable with `pip install ca2a-runtime`.
- [OPAQUE Systems](https://opaque.co) - The OPAQUE Confidential AI Platform™, with OPAQUE Agent Control™ for governing agent actions and OPAQUE Confidential Core™ for running them in TEEs with hardware attestation. Sponsor of this list and of the AgenTrust specifications (see [SPONSORS.md](SPONSORS.md)). The open cMCP and Agent Manifest repositories mark their OPAQUE attestation provider as not implemented. Commercial.
- [TRACE (Trust Runtime Attestation and Compliance Evidence)](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-spec) - Open specification (a Series of LF Projects, with an AAIF Sandbox proposal open) and Python SDK for portable, signed runtime evidence. Each agent run produces a signed record of model identity, runtime, policy version, and tool call transcript that anyone can check offline without calling the operator; hardware provenance requires separately verified attestation. Built on IETF RATS (RFC 9334), EAT (RFC 9711), SCITT, SLSA, and SPIFFE. Spec v0.2.
- [Weight Custody Manifest (WCM)](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest) - Open, pre-1.0 specification and Python SDK for releasing model-weight decryption keys only to a workload whose CPU (and, when required, GPU) attestation matches a signed manifest, with short-lived approval and evidence of each release. The reference SDK verifies AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, and NVIDIA H100 CC evidence captured on real hardware. Against an operator who physically owns the machine it offers accountability rather than cryptographic custody. Apache-2.0; `pip install weight-custody-manifest`; docs at [wcm.agentrust-io.com](https://wcm.agentrust-io.com).
- [SourceryKit](https://github.com/ProvablyAI/sourcerykit) - Verifies an agent's outbound requests and MCP handoffs against a source of truth using zero-knowledge proofs, so a call only goes out if the agent's claims check out. Hooks into the HTTP libraries, logs every outbound call, and blocks endpoints not on the trusted allow-list. Python, BSL 1.1 (source-available), with a hosted backend that runs the proof and source-of-truth check.

## Policy as Code

*Language-level tools for expressing, validating, and enforcing authorization policies applicable to agent capability bounds, tool access, and data permissions.*

- [Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/casbin) - Cross-language authorization library supporting ACL, RBAC, and ABAC models. Available in Go, Python, Java, and more.
- [Cedar](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar) - Amazon's policy language for fine-grained, type-safe access control. Used as the policy engine in the Agent Governance Toolkit. Fast, formally verified, and human-readable.
- [GOPAL](https://github.com/Principled-Evolution/gopal) - Apache-2.0 library of 85 Rego policies encoding AI-governance regulations (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ICAO/FAA/EASA aviation, FERPA/COPPA, fair lending) as executable allow/deny checks for the OPA engine, versioned per framework with allow/deny tests in CI.
- [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) - CNCF general-purpose policy engine. Decouples policy decisions from application logic using the Rego language. Widely deployed for Kubernetes and API authorization.
- [SpiceDB](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb) - Google Zanzibar-inspired database for fine-grained, relationship-based authorization. Useful for cross-agent and multi-tenant permission modeling.

## Agent Action Records

*Standards and services for recording, attesting, and verifying what an agent actually did — signed, content-addressed, offline-verifiable action records, receipts, and transparency logs. Distinct from Agent Identity & Attestation, which covers who the agent is.*

- [Agent Action Capsule (AAC)](https://github.com/action-state-group/agent-action-capsule) - Open SCITT statement profile (IETF draft-mih-scitt-agent-action-capsule) for recording and verifying what an AI agent did: each action is sealed into a content-addressed, offline-verifiable capsule (JCS/RFC 8785) a third party can check without calling the operator. Apache-2.0; reference library, test vectors, and standard site at agentactioncapsule.org.
- [agent-evidence-vectors](https://github.com/astrogilda/agent-evidence-vectors) - Apache-2.0 conformance corpora and reference verifiers for proposed agent-execution evidence predicates, SCITT/COSE carriage, and related evidence-binding profiles.
- [agent-trace](https://github.com/oleg-vdv/agent-trace) - MIT TypeScript verifier for Python-generated, hash-chained agent journals. Checks sequence, chain linkage, and record hashes, reporting the first failing record's sequence number. Developed in the ProofByte monorepo.
- [capsule-anchor](https://github.com/action-state-group/capsule-anchor) - Software for anyone to run their own vendor-neutral SCITT Transparency Service (RFC 9162): submit a digest, get a COSE receipt anchoring it into an append-only, independently auditable log that anyone can verify offline. Run your own, or use the free community instance at witness.agentactioncapsule.org. Apache-2.0.
- [capsule-emit](https://github.com/action-state-group/capsule-emit) - The reference implementation of Agent Action Capsule: a one-call `emit()` producer that seals an action into a capsule, anchors it by default, and ships a ledger-view CLI with thin framework adapters. Apache-2.0.
- [Nobulex](https://github.com/arian-gogani/nobulex) - Bilateral receipt primitive for tamper-evident agent audit trails: two Ed25519 signatures per action (pre- and post-execution), hash-chained via JCS canonicalization (RFC 8785). The receipt-signing approach is [merged into AGT](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/pull/1333). MIT licensed.
- [PIC Standard (Provenance & Intent Contracts)](https://github.com/madeinplutofabio/pic-standard) - Open, local-first protocol for pre-execution action gating in AI agents: the agent declares intent, provenance, and evidence before a high-impact tool call; the verifier returns allow or block, failing closed on missing or invalid evidence, under a Trust Axiom that trust is verifier-derived, not producer-asserted. Apache-2.0. Pre-v1.0 draft.
- [proofbundle](https://github.com/b7n0de/proofbundle) - Signed, portable receipts for AI evaluation and review results, verifiable offline with the public key alone: Ed25519 over canonical JSON (RFC 8785), RFC 6962 Merkle inclusion for samples, optional SD-JWT selective disclosure and in-toto statement export, a verifier with a fixed exit-code contract and a 130-case conformance corpus. Establishes evidence integrity, not whether the result is correct. MIT.
- [Signed Decision Receipts (IETF)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-farley-acta-signed-receipts/) - Internet-Draft defining a portable, cryptographically signed receipt format for machine-to-machine access control decisions. Ed25519 + JCS canonicalization. Independently verifiable offline.

- [YYLO Benchmark](https://github.com/yylo-dev/yylo-benchmark) - Evaluation layer for task prompts that records each attempt for verification: every candidate runs in a private fresh-repository workspace behind an initial workspace receipt plus a deterministic post-execution manifest covering Git HEAD/tree/refs/index/status and every worktree file; recovery reuses hash-verified terminals, and retained state is rejected unless the complete chain from state, plan, and attempt through receipt, manifest, terminal, and evidence forms one exact linkage. Deterministic and LLM-judge evaluations append immutable records with evidence and evaluator provenance hashes; running a plan grants no production or external authority. MIT; CLI `yylo-benchmark` (also delegated unchanged by `yy benchmark`) and library on npm as @yylo/benchmark; part of the YYLO suite alongside the YYLO CLI orchestrator.
